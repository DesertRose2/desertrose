# Smithing Fallout Edition

## What is this module?
Ancient TG smithing code remodeled, new art, lot of new code and concepts.

Core principles:
- Ingame documentation, not code diving (advice book, new description system)
- Visual/audio feedback and mood important
- Files sorted and defines used
- All items should be useful in some way, trade offs, gimmicks added
- Recipes organized so similar sorts of items use similar recipes (the more cutting, the more folds etc) 
- EVERYTHING must have icons AND inhands. No more terrible sword pikes.
- As little reliant on outdated external stuff as possible. So no Ratvar, Narsie stuff.

## Is it complete?
Sort of. It works, but the following was planned, before time and heart ran out. This is sort of a beta, but fully functional.

- Radial menus instead of the pop up menus
- Adding more gimmicks, mood modifiers, etc
- Balancing (depends on the codebase since armor and competition varies in the extreme)
- Perfecting sizing (standardized icon sizes, partway there but not all the way)
- Large icons (for 40x32 or so inhands, icons, for spears and the like mostly, ties in with above)
- Quenching affecting quality (intended 3 ways, air cooled, maybe 30s timer, -1, water temper normal, oil temper +1)
- X and Y offsets dynamic so the long items (spears etc) can have the workpiece centered then moved to the finished position once dofinish is done

## Whats new? 
So much its hard to list
Anvils: Three quality types, bad (tablevil), decent (sandvil), good (steel and legion) Also the Legion one gets a couple special recipes for the cultural type weapons.

Hammer quality a little less important, skill a little easier to earn XP for
Item quality much less impactful (this just means low quality items arent completely useless)

Light & Sound: Whole bunch of overlays, lighting, sounds added to all steps of the process

Steps: Heat ingot, place on anvil, hammer it, quench it, add finisher, done.

## Who dunnit

The base TG smithing module is still at the core, so full credit for that goes to its makers
A few items are made on old sprites as a base with moderate to heavy modification (scraptana, combat knife, anvil, bola, ring, sabre hilt)
Sounds are some from base FO13, some edited, some brand new, the anvil sounds are from royalty free sampling from videvo.net edited a lot in Audacity. Everything else is done by me, its a total makeover with almost everything changed in little or major ways.
Since I'll not be around to maintain this forever feel free to edit for fixing issues I might have missed or whatever but please keep it documented and not shitty, thanks.
